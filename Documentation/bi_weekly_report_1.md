Bi-Weekly Report 1
Team 48 (VR 3)

Team leader: Jasper Alizond
Members: Amartya Vadlamani
Date: 27/1/2017

Overview:

For the past week, we've been setting up a meeting with our client which we met with on the 27/1. We also did some light research
on the project (mainly 3D graphics and rendering on the Unity engine) and assigned team roles. We also started on the
documentation of the requirements gathered from our meeting.

Meetings:

24/1

After receiving the client information, we emailed the client and set up a meeting for the 27/1. We also created a github
repository and set up communication methods (such as using Facebook to set up project meetings). We then discussed the project
and did some light research on Virtual Reality in order to prepare for the client meeting. We also assigned team roles for the
project: 


27/1

We met before meeting the client in order to discuss how we should collect the requirements and what questions we would ask. We
went through the MoSCoW approach in order to efficiently collect all the requirements necessary to build the system as the
well the different types of requirements (functional and non-functional requirements).

Individual reports:

Jasper Alizond:

I emailed our client and established a meeting at the soonest date possible. I also discussed with my team member and assigned
team roles as well as establishing what questions we will ask the client. Finally I created a github repository allowing our team
to easily transfer code when working on our project.

Amartya Vadlamani:

I researched 3d rendering methods including marching cubes and relaxed surface nets. I also wrote up a small set of notes concerning the requirements of the project during the meeting with the client.
