Meetings:

24/1

After receiving the client information, we emailed the client and set up a meeting for the 27/1. We also created a github repository and set up communication methods (such as using Facebook to set up project meetings). We then discussed the project and did some light research on Virtual Reality in order to prepare for the client meeting.

27/1

We met before meeting the client in order to discuss how we should collect the requirements. We went through the MoSCoW approach in order to efficiently collect all the requirements necessary to build the system as the well the different types of requirements (functional and non-functional requirements).
